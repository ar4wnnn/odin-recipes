        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Falafel is a Middle Eastern dish made from chickpeas and/or fava beans. Traditionally, it is deep fried to yield a crispy texture and often served in a pita.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>1 15-ounce can chickpeas <i> (rinsed, drained and patted dry)</i></li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley <i> (or sub cilantro)</i></li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots <i> (minced // 2 shallots yield ~ 3/4 cup or 65 g // or sub white onion)</i></li>
            <li>2 Tbsp raw sesame seeds <i>(or sub finely chopped nuts, such as pecans)</i></li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp cumin <i>(plus more to taste)</i></li>
            <li>1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper <i> (plus more to taste)</i></li>
            <li>1 healthy pinch each cardamom and coriander <i> (optional)</i></li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp all-purpose flour <i> (or sub oat flour or gluten-free blend with varied results)</i></li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp avocado oil for cooking <i> (or sub any neutral oil with a high smoke point)</i></li>
            <li>Panko bread crumbs for coating <i> (optional // see instructions // gluten-free as needed)</i></li>\
        </ul>
            <br>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin, salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste (see photo).</li>
            <li>Add flour 1 Tbsp (~8 g) at a time and pulse/mix to combine until no longer wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to your hands – I used 4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt, pepper, and a dash of cardamom and coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty bold, so don’t be shy.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to firm up. If you’re in a hurry you can chill in the freezer for 45 minutes or skip this step – but they will be a little more fragile when cooking.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in weight // I used this scoop) and gently form into 11-12 small discs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
            <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>: Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to adhere – flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier falafel, but it’s optional.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to generously coat the pan – about 2 Tbsp (30 ml). Swirl to coat.</li>
            <li><b>NOTE</b>: If not cooking all of the falafel right away, FREEZE uncooked falafel between layers of parchment paper and store in a container in the freezer up to 1 month. Then just thaw and cook as instructed!</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very comfortably in the pan at a time – about 5-7.</li>
            <li>Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned – the deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they’ll be. They will also firm up more once slightly cooled.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with garlic-dill sauce or hummus, inside a pita or naan, and with desired toppings or atop a bed of greens.</li>
            <li>Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator covered for 4-5 days. Freeze after that to keep fresh for up to 1 month. From thawed, reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C)</li>
        </ol>
